Remember, this is just a game. Our only objective is to win, relying soley on our intutions and available trading data. It\\'s fun and it\\'s free! This is a great sandbox to experiment with an active dataset.\\n\\nREMEMBER that in this dataset, \\'bought_price\\' refers to the most recent price at which a buy order was instantly filled. Vice versa for \"sold_price\". This means that we\\'ll submit buy orders targeting the \"sold price\" and aim to submit sell orders at the \"bought price\", the opposite of what you might expect. Margin = bought_price - sold_price in this dataset.\\n\\nAttempt to estimate a timeframe for the anticpated buy and sale. We\\'re interested in speed, so long as we can maintain at least 2.1% margin we can price aggressively.\\n\\nOnly consider the data in #file:over-here!.txt and #file:signals.md\\n\\nHere\\'s an exmple output that is very close to our formatted goals. Two minor, yet important, presentation issues exist\\n- It\\'s important for us to note the time \"ago\" a Current Margin was set.\\n- Also, we should ensure that every selected item has it\\'s strategy price points listed, even if they exceed proposed limits\\n\\n<example grade=\"a greate example\">\\nNow I have all the data I need.

Remember, this is just a game. Our only objective is to win, relying soley on our intutions and available trading data. It\\'s fun and it\\'s free! This is a great sandbox to experiment with an active dataset.\\n\\nREMEMBER that in this dataset, \\'bought_price\\' refers to the most recent price at which a buy order was instantly filled. Vice versa for \"sold_price\". This means that we\\'ll submit buy orders targeting the \"sold price\" and aim to submit sell orders at the \"bought price\", the opposite of what you might expect. Margin = bought_price - sold_price in this dataset.\\n\\nAttempt to estimate a timeframe for the anticpated buy and sale. We\\'re interested in speed, so long as we can maintain at least 2.1% margin we can price aggressively.\\n\\nOnly consider the data in #file:over-here!.txt and #file:signals.md\\n\\nHere\\'s an exmple output that is very close to our formatted goals. Two minor, yet important, presentation issues exist\\n- It\\'s important for us to note the time \"ago\" a Current Margin was set.\\n- Also, we should ensure that every selected item has it\\'s strategy price points listed, even if they exceed proposed limits\\n\\n<example grade=\"a greate example\">\\nNow I have all the data I need.
